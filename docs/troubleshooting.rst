Trouble-Shooting Guide
======================

Reporting Problems
------------------

If you have any trouble during *pimp-my-box* installation and
configuration, or using any of the commands used, join the `pyroscope-users`_
mailing list or the inofficial ``##rtorrent`` channel on
``irc.freenode.net``. IRC will generally provide a faster resolution.

If you are sure there is a bug, then `open an issue`_ on *GitHub*.
Make sure that nobody else reported the same problem before you,
there is a `search box`_ you can use (after the **Filter** button).
Please note that the *GitHub* issue tracker is not a support platform,
use the mailing list or IRC for that.

.. note::

    Please **describe your problem clearly**, and provide any pertinent
    information.
    What are the **version numbers** of software and OS?
    What did you do?
    What was the **unexpected result**?
    If things worked and ‘suddenly’ broke, **what did you change**?

    **On IRC, don't ask if somebody is there, just describe your problem**.
    Eventually, someone will notice you – IRC is a global medium, and
    people *do* live in different time zones than you.

    Put up any logs on `0bin <http://0bin.net/>`_ or any other pastebin
    service, and **make sure you removed any personal information** you
    don't want to be publically known. Copy the pastebin link into IRC
    or into your post.
